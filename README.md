## Overview
### Description
GymKhana is an iOS mobile application which publishes crowd-sourced reviews about gyms as well as online reservation service for gyms for limited days.

### App Evaluation

- **Market:** Any gym enthusiastic individual could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used more often when people travel and wanted to continue their excersise routine. 
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing gyms near by locations in town based on their services and the price that they can offer to members, then we could launch later outside the city after success in town.
